They will need to ensure that the application scales smoothly and provides clear uptime data, and that they analyze and respond to any issues that occur. Existing Technical Environment - HipLocal's environment is a mix of on-premises hardware and infrastructure running in Google Cloud Platform. The HipLocal team understands their application well, but has limited experience in global scale applications. Their existing technical environment is as follows: • Existing APIs run on Compute Engine virtual machine instances hosted in GCP. • State is stored in a single instance MySQL database in GCP. • Release cycles include development freezes to allow for QA testing. • The application has no logging. • Applications are manually deployed by infrastructure engineers during periods of slow traffic on weekday evenings. • There are basic indicators of uptime; alerts are frequently fired when the APIs are unresponsive. Business Requirements - HipLocal's investors want to expand their footprint and support the increase in demand they are seeing. Their requirements are: • Expand availability of the application to new regions. • Support 10x as many concurrent users. • Ensure a consistent experience for users when they travel to different regions. • Obtain user activity metrics to better understand how to monetize their product. • Ensure compliance with regulations in the new regions (for example, GDPR). • Reduce infrastructure management time and cost. • Adopt the Google-recommended practices for cloud computing. ○ Develop standardized workflows and processes around application lifecycle management. ○ Define service level indicators (SLIs) and service level objectives (SLOs). Technical Requirements - • Provide secure communications between the on-premises data center and cloud-hosted applications and infrastructure. • The application must provide usage metrics and monitoring. • APIs require authentication and authorization. • Implement faster and more accurate validation of new features. • Logging and performance metrics must provide actionable information to be able to provide debugging information and alerts. • Must scale to meet user demand. For this question, refer to the HipLocal case study. HipLocal is expanding into new locations. They must capture additional data each time the application is launched in a new European country. This is causing delays in the development process due to constant schema changes and a lack of environments for conducting testing on the application changes. How should they resolve the issue while meeting the business requirements?","A. Create new Cloud SQL instances in Europe and North America for testing and deployment. Provide developers with local MySQL instances to conduct testing on the application changes.
B. Migrate data to Bigtable. Instruct the development teams to use the Cloud SDK to emulate a local Bigtable development environment.
C. Move from Cloud SQL to MySQL hosted on Compute Engine. Replicate hosts across regions in the Americas and Europe. Provide developers with local MySQL instances to conduct testing on the application changes.
D. Migrate data to Firestore in Native mode and set up instances in Europe and North America. Instruct the development teams to use the Cloud SDK to emulate a local Firestore in Native mode development environment.",https://www.examtopics.com/discussions/google/view/92053-exam-professional-cloud-developer-topic-1-question-189/
